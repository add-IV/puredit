# This is the live demo to the paper Virtual Domain Specific Languages via
# Embedded Projectional Editing by Niklas Korz and Artur Andrzejak, published
# at 22nd International Conference on Generative Programming:
# Concepts & Experiences (GPCE 2023), in conjunction with ACM SPLASH 2023,
# 22-27 October 2023, Cascais, Portugal.

# On the left, you see the projectional editor and on the right, the
# underlying textual source code. Both edit the same model and any changes
# to one side are reflected directly on the other side.

# Module mathdsl defines an internal DSL, whose operations are then transformed
# into visual equations by our projectional editor.
# The code of the internal DSL can be found at
# https://github.com/niklaskorz/puredit/blob/main/apps/example/public/examples/mathdsl.py
# while the projections are defined in
# https://github.com/niklaskorz/puredit/tree/main/apps/example/src/py/projections
# The projections make use of the https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/ library (MIT license).

# Click on the blue keyboard icon to edit a mathematical expression.
# You also type directly using your keyboard. Commonly used names such as "pi"
# or "theta" are automatically replaced by their greek letters.
# Click anywhere else inside the editor to close the mathematical keyword again.
# You can run the Python code by pressing on the blue, bottom-right "Execute"
# button.
# Note that the first time pressing it will take some time to load as it
# retrieves a WebAssembly Python environment to be able to execute the code
# inside your web browser.

# 1. Example: A math term transformed into function.
# Click on the blue keyboard icon 
f, args = mathdsl.compile("20\\pi^2+\\sin x")
print("f(x):", f(x=90))

# 2. Example: A math term with a matrix.
rotate, args = mathdsl.compile("\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\ y\\end{pmatrix}")
print("rotate(x, y, theta):")
print(rotate(x=1, y=2, theta=0.5))

# 3. Example:
# A math term evaluated immediately, using variables from the local scope.
# You can try to define new variables in the lines before the term
# and then use them inside the equation editor.
r = 5
x = mathdsl.evaluate("r^r", locals())
print("x:", x)

# 5. Example: Projections with aggregations and chains

    ], value_vars=[

    ], variable_name="city",
    value_name="average_temperature"

    ).filter(age=24)
    .drop_nulls()
    .group_by("age")
    .agg(
        "last_name",
        pl.col("semster").avg()
    ).rename({"last_name": "LastName"})
    .drop("LastName")
)

# CONTEXT: { "item": "string", "item_price": "number", "quantity": "number" }

    (pl.col("item_pice") + pl.col("quantity")).alias("total_price")
